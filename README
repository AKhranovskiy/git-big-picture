Program Description
===================

When run from within a git working tree, this python script generates
a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the hierarchy of all tags and
branches present in the git repository.

It uses an easy-to-write Graphviz syntax to output the graph data for
the repository. The output will then be processes by the Graphviz
`dot' utility to convert it to a picture in various formats, e.g. SVG
or PNG.

Installation
============

You just need a working Python installation on your machine. If you
want to convert the output to an actual image, you'll also have to
install the `graphviz' tool. (To check whether this tool is installed,
perform a call to `dot -V' and check if there's something about the
Graphviz version.)

Usage
=====

To generate a graph (for example in PNG format), simply cd to the git
directory, call the program, and pipe the output to the Graphviz `dot'
utility to convert it to PNG:

    $ ./git-big-picture | dot -Tpng -ograph.png

You'll then have a file called 'graph.png' in your current working
directory. If you replace 'png' with 'svg', you'll get a SVG file
instead. See `man dot' for further information about output modes
supported.
